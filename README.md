# MechaCar_Analysis

## Background
A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

# Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils 
- Lot 1 = variance of 0.98 PASS
- Lot 2 = variance of 7.47 PASS
- Lot 3 has a variance of 170.29 FAIL

# Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

In order to create a good study between the MechaCar and the competition, based on the data as well as the weight of the data possibility for variables, there are many differnt things that can be takingin to consideration; rate of cost // weight, the rate of miles per gallon, applical qualities to the consumer. The goal of pushing the most profitable study for the MechaCar is fully depenndent in the rate of approval across multiple varibles for the consumer. When looking at the range of variables there becomes a schewed range which can be dependent. In this study however I think the most applical value to all to  determine what makes MechaCar superior will be to compare HP with the other variables I listed above. One would need to look to the cutomer reviews but also preform further cutomer analysis on the grade of value that is put on the value of individual variables.
